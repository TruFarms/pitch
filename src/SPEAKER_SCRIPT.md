### Slide 1: Project Vision

**(Visual: Hero image with the TruFarms logo and vision statement)**

"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your time. My name is Quinton Jones, and I'm the founder of TruFarms.

Our vision is clear and ambitious: to become the leading cannabis extraction hub in Greater Minnesota. We are driven by a mission that combines strict compliance, science-backed manufacturing, and community-focused operations. Our goal isn't just to enter a market; it's to set new standards for quality, reliability, and patient care in a region with enormous potential."

### Slide 2: Startup Summary

**(Visual: Four key points - Mission, Location, Team, Objectives)**

"So, what is TruFarms? At our core, we are a cannabis extraction and manufacturing microbusiness. Our mission is to fill a critical gap by producing high-quality THC vape cartridges, edibles, and concentrates for licensed dispensaries, right here in Southeast Minnesota.

Our strategic location in Rochester is key. It places us at the epicenter of a significant patient and consumer population, largely driven by the world-renowned Mayo Clinic.

This will be executed by a dedicated team of specialists in extraction, compliance, and operations, ensuring we launch with excellence.

Our objectives are concrete: We aim to launch with our products in 25 licensed dispensaries, achieve between $600,000 and $1.2 million in our first year of revenue, and scale to over $3.5 million by year three."

### Slide 3: The Problem

**(Visual: Highlighted text on supply shortage, partnership gap, and entry barriers)**

"So, why is this opportunity so significant? The problem is simple: there is a critical supply gap in a high-demand emerging market.

Right now, there are no licensed extraction operations in Southeast Minnesota. This creates a supply shortage for consumers and a major partnership gap for local cultivators, who lack a regional partner for B2B extraction and manufacturing.

Furthermore, the high cost and complexity of setting up these facilities create a significant barrier to entry, preventing many smaller businesses from meeting this demand themselves. This is the void TruFarms is built to fill."

### Slide 4: Our Solution

**(Visual: Highlighted text on first-mover advantage, branded products, B2B services)**

"Our solution is a strategic, multi-faceted approach designed to capture this underserved market.

First, we will leverage our first-mover advantage, establishing TruFarms as the first and only dedicated extraction microbusiness in the region.

Second, we will develop a strong portfolio of branded products—from vape cartridges to edibles and pre-rolls—for direct wholesale to dispensaries.

And third, we will become a critical supply-chain partner for other businesses by offering white-label manufacturing and toll processing services. We are not just building a brand; we are building the manufacturing backbone for the entire region."

---

### Slide 5: Products & B2B Services

**(Visual: Icons and descriptions for Pre-Rolls, Vapes, Concentrates, and B2B Services)**

"Our product portfolio is designed to meet the full spectrum of consumer needs. We'll offer machine-packed pre-rolls, including premium infused options, as well as high-quality vape cartridges and precisely dosed gummies. For the experienced consumer, we will produce high-potency concentrates like shatter, wax, and crumble.

Crucially, our B2B services will provide the foundation for other brands to thrive through white-label manufacturing and toll processing, making us an indispensable partner in the local cannabis ecosystem."

### Slide 6: Market Opportunity

**(Visual: Four key stats with icons)**

"The market opportunity in Rochester and Olmsted County is substantial and growing. We are talking about a county with over 160,000 residents and an estimated monthly retail market of around $6 million.

The real game-changer, however, is the Mayo Clinic, which attracts over 1.3 million patients and their families annually—a massive, health-conscious demographic.

Our goal is to capture a conservative 10% of this market. And as the only licensed extraction operation in Southeast Minnesota at launch, we will have a significant head start, creating a strong barrier to entry for future competitors."

---

### Slide 7: Marketing & Sales Strategy

**(Visual: Four points on healthcare outreach, digital presence, partnerships, community engagement)**

"Our marketing strategy is targeted and community-focused. We will engage directly with healthcare professionals and patient advocacy groups to build trust and educate them on the quality and benefits of our products.

A strong digital presence will establish our brand, while strategic partnerships with dispensaries will be our primary sales channel. We will be more than a supplier; we'll be a reliable partner, offering marketing support to help them sell our products.

Finally, we will embed ourselves in the community through local health and wellness events, building brand loyalty from the ground up."

---

### Slide 8: Monthly Production Targets

**(Visual: Two bar charts showing bulk and unit production numbers)**

"Our facility is designed for scale from day one. Our initial monthly production targets include producing 10,000 vape cartridges, 25,000 pre-rolls, and thousands of units of other products.

On the bulk side, we are targeting 10 liters of distillate and 20 kilograms of concentrates monthly. This capacity ensures we can meet significant wholesale demand for both our branded products and our B2B partners immediately upon launch."

---

### Slide 9: Leadership

**(Visual: Photos, names, and bios of the founding team)**

"None of this is possible without the right leadership. I, Quinton Jones, will be leading our overall strategy and business development. I'm joined by Alexander McKinnon, our Head of Production, who will manage all facility operations, and Tyson Carter, our Head of Extraction, who brings deep expertise in producing high-quality concentrates.

This core team will be supported by a staff of nine specialists, ensuring we have the expertise needed for a robust and compliant operational launch."

### Slide 10: Financial Projections

**(Visual: Table with ROI data and a bar chart of 3-year revenue and profit)**

"Let's talk about the numbers. Our financial model is strong and built on realistic projections. As you can see from our Return on Investment example for a single 40lb run, the profitability is significant, with an ROI of over 170%.

Scaling this, our projections show a clear path to profitability within the first year. We anticipate revenues of over $1 million in Year 1, growing to $3.5 million by Year 3, with net profits scaling to over $700,000 in that same timeframe. This is a financially sound and highly scalable business model."

---

### Slide 11: Funding Request & Use of Proceeds

**(Visual: Breakdown of how the $400k investment will be used)**

"To make this vision a reality, we are seeking $400,000 in startup capital.

This investment is allocated strategically to cover all critical launch expenses. 75% of the funds will be dedicated to the C1D1 extraction lab, and all associated lease, legal, and licensing fees. The remaining capital will be used for product packaging and pre-roll equipment.

This funding makes TruFarms fully operational and positions us to be profitable within our first year."
